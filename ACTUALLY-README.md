I can search different images for design inspiration on Behance, Pinterest, just Google search, Portfolio website examples, etc.

Design tool - Figma, ofc.

For development: React with routing, GSAP for animations (also need text animations - maybe will use svg instead of text in some cases), maybe will use D3 later, when learned
